# Icon SVG Creator

## Description

This was a fun little project that I might come back to again. I got to work with inquirer some more along with being introduced to SVG, and I figured out
how to use different classes within it all.

## Installation

All that's needed is to install the required packages using "npm install".

After installing the required packages, run using "node index.js" and the user will be prompted with 4 questions in the terminal.
After answering these questions, an .svg file will have been made to be used!
